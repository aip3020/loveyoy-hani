		<h1>Happy 4th monthsary, my baby (⁠ ⁠◜⁠‿⁠◝⁠ ⁠)⁠♡</h1>
		<h2>Read well cutie</h2>
		<p>
			Happy 4th monthsary to my baby, soulmate, girlfriend, best friend, other half, and the love of my life. I still can't process that we've made it this far kahit na andaming tampuhan at away na nangyari between the two of us. I promise you na even though things get rough for us, never ever ako mag gigive up. No matter how hard our situation is, I will always choose to fix it with you rather than ending things and stop having you as my endgame.
